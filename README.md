- HTML;

- JavaScript;
- Git.

<br/>

## Project
This is a timer to help the user focus on a task.<br>
This timer is based on the [previous timer project](../focus-timer-enhanced/), but it has extra controls and a few other things.<br>
In this project, i reused the FocusTimer 2.0 code and made a few adjustments. Added new features and improved the code overall with some refactoring.<br>
Features:
- A timer which you can set a custom time or add/subtract five minutes from the current time.
- Multiple relaxing background noises (forest, rain, coffee shop and fireplace). Also, each sound has a volume slider.
- Dark/light mode.
